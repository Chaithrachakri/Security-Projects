For execution of code

Version - Python 2.7.6

How to run Server:
Command: "python chatserver.py --sp 9090"


How to run Client:
Command: "python chatclient.py --sip 127.0.0.1 --sp 9090"
Greet the server: Greeting

It prompts for greeting it only greets if user types "Greeting"
user starts typing only after 'start typing message'
I have a 5 second loop for server to respond or else client prints error message and exits

Note:
* I used unique identifier in my code. I started code with assumption that this is part of final project and wanted to consider it as session identifier.
